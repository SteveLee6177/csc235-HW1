Submitted by user <B> iosborn22 </B>. Blue morpho butterflys wings are bright blue, edged with black. Blue morpho is
among the largest butterflies in the world, with wings spanning from five to eight inches. When blue morpho
flies, the contrasting bright <span class = "highlight">blue </span> and <span class = "highlightB">dull brown </span> colors flash, making it look like the morpho is appearing
and disappearing.
